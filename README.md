# biodiversity_in_national_park
This project is about biodiversity in national parks

**INTRODUCTION**

This project is about biodiversity in national parks and has data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

**SCOPE**

GOALS

-  To interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

- To perform some analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

DATA

species_info.csv - contains data about different species and their conservation status

observations.csv - holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.

The datasets provided have the following columns of data:

species_info.csv:

category - class of animal
scientific_name - the scientific name of each species
common_name - the common names of each species
conservation_status - each species’ current conservation status
observations.csv:

scientific_name - the scientific name of each species
park_name - Park where species were found
observations - the number of times each species was observed at park

ANALYSIS

Some components to  be discussed in this project include:
- What is the distribution of conservation_status for animals?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which species were spotted the most at each park?
